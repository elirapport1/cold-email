template 1:
Dear _,

I know you're incredibly busy and you get a lot of emails, so this will 
only take 60 seconds to read. 

One to two sentences max of who you am and why that's relevant to the person 
you are emailing.

One to two sentences of a hyper-specific question only they can answer without
thinking too hard

I totally understand, if you're too busy to respond, even a one or two line 
reply will completely make my day.

All the best,
Eli

notes: 
for startups, I should be reaching out to the CEOs or if they have a HR head/recruiter
look to see if I have a mutual connection with the person of contact and reach out
to the mutual connection via template 2

for small startups if I can't find their emails, put first name company name into 
email-checker.net
